# NSCLC pY Correlation Force Network

## Overview
This repository contains the interactive force network visualization of tyrosine phosphorylation (pY) correlations in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) samples. The project aims to illustrate the kinase activity starmap in NSCLC, revealing distinct phosphorylation profiles and their implications for cancer research and personalized therapy.

## Features
- Interactive force network visualization of pY correlations.
- Distinction between tumor and normal adjacent tissues (NATs).
- Identification of key kinase activity clusters (constellations): Adherens Junctions, Cancer Drivers, Blood Cells, and Immune Signaling.
- Insights into molecular mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets.

## Usage
Access the interactive network [here](https://deepkinase.github.io/nsclc-pycornet/).

### Local Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nsclc-pycornet.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd nsclc-pycornet
   ```
3. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view the network locally.

## Data
The data used for the visualization includes tyrosine phosphorylation sites identified and quantified in 74 NSCLC patients. The analysis was conducted using SH2-Superbinder and data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry.
